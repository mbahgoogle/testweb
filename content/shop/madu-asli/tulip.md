After researching hundreds of laptops and testing six, we found that 
the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA is the best laptop that costs less 
than $500. It has a brighter screen, a more comfortable keyboard, 
and a more responsive trackpad than Windows laptops in this price range, 
and it’s powerful enough for most people’s needs. It’s faster at the 
tasks most people use laptops for: browsing the Web (even with a ton of 
tabs open), basic word processing, and watching movies. And since it’s 
a Chromebook, it’s free of the bloatware that slows down its Windows 
competitors.

The best laptop under $500

Plenty of performance for everyday tasks, a 
comfortable backlit keyboard, and the build 
quality of laptops twice the price.

Chromebooks don’t run Windows, and most tasks require you to be online, 
but you can use Office apps in the browser (with a subscription) if you 
need to take occasional work home, and Chrome OS has viable replacements 
(including Android apps) for the software most people use. The Chromebook 
Flip’s 12.5-inch, 1920×1080 IPS touchscreen is crisp and vibrant, and its 
Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of flash storage are 
fast enough for most people. It’s small and lightweight, and its battery 
can last a full work day. The C302CA is also classier looking than its 
Windows counterparts in this price range—the aluminum case could be 
mistaken for that of a $1,000 ultrabook at a glance.





{{< productlist title="2. Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP401CA-DHMT4" link="https://amzn.to/2Mk9lDT" img="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/27163/Asus-VivoBook-Flip-14-TP401CA-DHMT4_20180703-212028_full.jpeg">}}
Sleek for a cheap Windows laptop, the VivoBook Flip 14 has a great screen, comfortable keyboard, and smooth trackpad, though it lacks a variety of ports.

{{< button class="btn btn-warning" title="$475* from Amazon" link="https://amzn.to/2Mk9lDT">}}

{{< /productlist >}}

If you need Windows apps or prefer to work offline, we recommend the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP401CA-DHMT4 because it’s the best Windows laptop under $500. Its Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of eMMC flash storage are enough to handle common tasks, though don’t expect to use Photoshop, Spotify, and have dozens of browser tabs open at the same time. The VivoBook Flip’s 14-inch, 1920×1080 IPS touchscreen is brighter and better to look at than other Windows laptops in this price range, and compared to those Windows computers, the VivoBook Flip has superior build quality and portability. But it can’t match the Chromebook Flip’s screen, build quality, and portability, and it lacks the Chromebook’s keyboard backlighting. Its battery also won’t last a full work or school day like the Chromebook’s, and, like all inexpensive Windows laptops, the VivoBook Flip 14 comes with a ton of bloatware. It also has only one USB-C port and a Micro-USB port: no USB-A ports.





{{< productlist title="3. Acer Spin 3 SP315-51-37UY" link="https://amzn.to/2Mk9lDT" img="https://d1b5h9psu9yexj.cloudfront.net/27164/Acer-Spin-3-SP315-51-37UY_20180703-212049_full.jpeg">}}
The Spin 3 is gigantic and ugly, but it has the best performance and most storage for the price.

{{< button class="btn btn-warning" title="$475* from Amazon" link="https://amzn.to/2Mk9lDT">}}

{{< /productlist >}}

If the VivoBook Flip 14 isn’t available, or if you need a bigger screen, more ports, or a number pad on the keyboard, buy the Acer Spin 3 SP315-51-37UY. It has the best components of any laptop we tested for this review, including a 128 GB SSD, an Intel Core i3 processor, and 4 GB of memory. You can even add more memory later to run more apps and browser tabs simultaneously, which will also extend your laptop’s life for a couple years. But the Acer’s screen isn’t as bright and vibrant as our other picks’, the trackpad is rattly, and the gigantic plastic case feels cheap, scratches easily, and weighs nearly five pounds. And like the Flip 14, the Spin 3 comes with a ton of bloatware.

## Why you should trust us
Wirecutter has been researching and testing laptops since 2013, and our PC team has more than 20 years of collective experience reviewing all kinds of laptops.

I’ve spent more than six years writing about technology and have spent a lifetime using, fixing, and toying with budget electronics. For this guide alone, I researched hundreds of laptops under $500, built spreadsheets to note every available configuration, and spent weeks working from a variety of budget laptops.

## Who this is for
Our picks are for anyone who doesn’t want to or cannot spend more than $500 on a laptop. These models are good for students who don’t need special software, anyone who just wants to browse the Web, and people who take work home only occasionally. If you can spend more or need a laptop capable of creative tasks, heavy multitasking, or gaming, take a look at our guide to the best laptops to find which suits your needs.

For less than $500, Chromebooks are better than Windows laptops because they’re faster at the things most people use a laptop for. In this price range, they also tend to have better build quality; superior screens, keyboards, and trackpads; and longer battery life than their Windows counterparts. Chromebooks don’t need antivirus software, don’t come with bloatware, and their system updates happen automatically.

Chromebooks run Chrome OS, an operating system that uses the Chrome Web browser as its primary interface. If you spend your computing time in a browser—checking email, using Google’s productivity suite, watching Netflix, or reading social media—then Chrome OS is all you need. But a Chromebook isn’t for everyone. For example, Chrome has limited options for photo, video, and audio editing software and programming text editors. Popular programs like Office 365 and Adobe Lightroom do have Web-based or Android versions, but if you need specialized software for work or school, you’re better off with Windows or macOS.

Chromebooks also need an Internet connection for most tasks—you can’t even set one up without Internet access. Chromebooks do have offline options for Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, and Keep, as well as offline playback for movies, music, and some games. But the offline experience requires you to set it up while you have an Internet connection, and offline mode isn’t as cohesive as on Windows.

You should consider a $500 Windows laptop as a last resort if you have to buy a laptop right now. A $500 Windows laptop can handle basic web browsing, light app use, and media consumption, but not much more. It will buckle under the load of running four or five light apps at a time, so it isn’t great for heavy multitasking. Compared to a $700 laptop, it will feel worse in everyday use in two years and you’ll need to replace it sooner; a cheap laptop may cost you more in the long term. People who need a cheap Windows laptop are better off saving up for a $700 budget ultrabook or holding out for a sale—at the right time of year, even $600 can get you a more durable computer with better performance that will last longer than our picks.

If you don’t need Windows, you prefer Apple’s platforms, or you mostly watch videos and play games, an iPad with a keyboard case (or standalone keyboard) is snappier than a $400 Windows laptop for banging out a few emails, watching movies, or taking notes, and there are thousands of iPad-optimized apps and games. An iPad won’t run traditional desktop apps.

## How we picked

You’re not going to get a perfect laptop for less than $500—if it was perfect, it wouldn’t be cheap. The best configuration for a $500 Windows laptop is at least a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core i3 or Core m3 processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 64 GB or 128 GB solid-state or eMMC (flash) drive, and a 1080p screen. (Go higher than these specs if you can—8 GB of memory in particular makes a big difference—but never lower.) To learn what to look for in a Chromebook, head over to our Chromebook guide.

You can get laptops as cheap as $200, but you really shouldn’t—it’s more pleasant to browse the Web on your phone. You have to pay at least $450 for a usable Windows laptop. Cheaper laptops have slow hard drives or abysmal processors that can’t handle more than one or two applications at a time. They’re huge, creaky monstrosities with washed out screens and mediocre keyboards and trackpads that will likely fall apart within a year. If you can’t spend more than $450, you’ll have a better experience with a Chromebook or a tablet. Even at this price, you make serious trade-offs, so it’s worth knowing how components affect your experience:

- Storage: Most Windows laptops at this price have spinning hard drives that feel unbearably slow—booting the laptop, launching apps, and browsing files take so long that you have time to take a sip of coffee and stretch before you can do anything. In our testing, we found that having flash storage (ideally an SSD, but an eMMC drive is also fast enough) instead of a traditional hard drive dramatically improved everyday performance, even more than a faster processor or more memory. But avoid Windows laptops with less than 64 GB of flash storage—you can’t run Windows updates on them without an external drive. You could buy a laptop with a hard drive and replace it with an SSD later to save some money, but that’s more than most people feel comfortable doing, so we concentrated on models that come with flash storage.
- Processor: We recommend a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core m3, Core i3, or Core i5 processor. The Core i3 and m3 options will be fine for casual use and basic schoolwork but aren’t the best for multitasking; the Core i5 is faster and better at multitasking, but rare in this price range. Avoid AMD processors like the dual-core A9 and Intel Pentium and Celeron processors like the N4200 and N5000. We found these processors to be unusable for more than a single open app in our tests.
- Memory: For less than $500, you rarely get more than 4 GB of memory without sacrificing flash storage or a decent processor. In our testing, we found that memory was the best spec to compromise on—a laptop with 4 GB of memory felt better to use than a laptop with more RAM but a hard drive or a slow processor. Laptop Mag found 4 GB of memory can run about 10 to 15 open browser tabs (assuming you don’t have any other apps open), and is good for basic document work with smaller files. Our tests found similar results, but once you open another app, the usable number of tabs plummets to five to 10 and decreases with each additional app. If you multitask in many apps at once, you’ll need more memory.
- Screen: Cheap laptops tend to come with cheap 1366×768 screens. We preferred models with a resolution of 1920×1080, which offers a clear image and more screen real estate. We also recommend in-plane switching (IPS) screens because they’re more color accurate and have better viewing angles than TN (twisted nematic) panels. If you do a lot of media streaming, you’ll notice the difference.
- Keyboard and trackpad: The keyboard and trackpad should be tolerable and responsive. Neither should annoy you so much that you seek out an external keyboard and mouse. Backlit keyboards are a bonus, but rare in this range.
- Build quality: No budget laptop is a paragon of industrial design, but a computer shouldn’t feel like it’s going to break. Many laptops in this price range are massive 15-inch beasts with cheap plastic cases, loose keys, and rattly trackpads. A decent laptop should be sturdy, shouldn’t flex beneath your fingers when you type, and shouldn’t creak every time you click the trackpad or tap the spacebar.
- Bloatware: Cheap Windows laptops come with a ton of bloatware, and it’s especially problematic on these laptops with slower processors, less memory, and limited storage. We recommend getting rid of useless applications with Should I Remove It? to speed up boot time, sew up potential security holes, and eliminate annoying notifications. In our tests, we experienced mild performance bumps after removing bloatware.

For $500, you don’t get much control over features we consider in more expensive laptops, like size, battery life, or ports, so while those details are nice to know, they didn’t make or break any of our picks. We just wanted to find usable laptops.

## How we tested

To figure out which components have the greatest impact on general use, we first tested three Windows laptops:

- One with an Intel Celeron processor, eMMC storage, and 4 GB of memory
- One with a Core i3 processor, a hard drive, and 8 GB of memory
- One with a Core i3 processor, SSD, and 4 GB of memory

We used each for a full day of work, which consisted of having a four to five applications open at once alongside a browser with 10 to 15 tabs. We also benchmarked each laptop with PC Mark 8’s Work and Home tests. Based on these tests, we found that flash storage is the most important component, followed by a decent processor, with 4 GB of memory being the best compromise to make.

Once we settled on our ideal configuration, we tested four Windows laptops and two Chromebooks by using each for at least a day of ordinary work to get a feel for their performance, screens, keyboards, and trackpads. For Chromebooks, we had at least 20 browser tabs open: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Spotify, Slack, and a variety of other sites. For Windows, we had five to 10 tabs open at a time, as well as the Spotify and Slack applications. We also tested opening large Excel spreadsheets, 100-page Word documents, and 200-page PDF files.




## Our pick: Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA

The Asus Chromebook Flip C302A is the best laptop under $500 for most people because it performs solidly and has a brighter screen, more responsive trackpad, and more comfortable backlit keyboard than its Windows competitors. It also features a sturdy, premium-feeling aluminum case. The Chromebook Flip costs about the same and has similar specs as the Windows laptop picks in this guide, but it feels much snappier for everyday work, plus it doesn’t come with bloatware and it’s more secure. But Chrome OS can’t run Windows apps, and because the Flip has only USB-C ports, you’ll need a dongle or adapter cable to connect your USB-A devices.

The Chromebook Flip has 64 GB of eMMC storage, which is fast enough that you won’t notice any slowdown in everyday use. It has plenty of room to store a few movies for a flight, and most of your data will live in the cloud anyway—Google provides 100 GB of Google Drive storage for two years. The Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor and 4 GB of RAM are also sufficient for Chrome OS, and the Chromebook Flip feels snappy to use, even if you’re used to high-end laptops. Even with 30 tabs open (with some playing media), the Chromebook Flip was quick and responsive. Because Chrome OS doesn’t need as much memory as Windows, Chromebooks didn’t suffer the same slowdowns we experienced under similar loads on similarly specced Windows laptops.


The Chromebook Flip’s IPS touchscreen is brighter and has better viewing angles than the one on the VivoBook Flip 14, our Windows pick; it’s great for media consumption and web browsing. At 12.5 inches, the 1920×1080-pixel screen is small—but not uncomfortably so for getting work done—especially compared to the VivoBook Flip 14’s 14-inch display or the Spin 3’s gargantuan 15-inch screen. Like our other picks, the Chromebook Flip has a 360-degree hinge so you can flip the screen around to use as a tablet, or in any intermediate position. This is more useful on the smaller Chromebook Flip than on the VivoBook Flip 14 or the massive 15-inch Spin 3.

The Chromebook Flip’s keyboard is comfortable and responsive, and the backlit keys are a rarity in laptops in this price range. The keys are nicely spaced and don’t feel cramped to type on, and the Chromebook Flip’s all-aluminum chassis makes for a sturdier typing experience than the VivoBook Flip 14’s plastic-bottom case. The trackpad feels smooth and accurate, especially when compared with the Spin 3’s rattly, loose trackpad.


The Chromebook Flip looks and feels like a higher-priced laptop—you could mistake it for a $1,000 ultrabook from across a coffee shop. After a year of regular use, the aluminum case and hinges on our test unit still look brand new aside from a couple scratches. The VivoBook Flip 14 has a similar case, but only the top is aluminum; the keyboard and trackpad are housed in plastic. The Chromebook consequently feels much more solid. Both Flips are higher quality than the Spin 3, a gigantic chunk of cheap plastic weighing in at 4.7 pounds. They’re lighter, too: The Chromebook Flip weighs just 2.65 pounds and the VivoBook Flip 14 comes in at 3.2 pounds. And unlike the behemoth Spin 3, the 12-by-8.3-by-0.6-inch Chromebook Flip and the 12.9-by-8.9-by-0.6-inch VivoBook Flip 14 are small enough to be easily portable.

In our battery-life test with the screen at 40 percent brightness and the keyboard backlight off, the Flip lasted 8 hours and 7 minutes. That means it’ll last about a full day at work or school, or the duration of a cross-country flight.

Chromebooks are free from the worst part of cheap Windows laptops: bloatware. Every Chromebook comes with the operating system alone—no manufacturer-added software. You still have to update the operating system for new features and security enhancements, but these updates happen automatically and are much faster than Windows updates. Chromebooks are more secure than Windows laptops, too, because most malware (like ransomware, for example) isn’t made for Chromebooks. You’re limited to apps in the Chrome Web Store and Google Play; while those platforms aren’t completely free of malware, a bad extension or app can’t compromise your system in the same way as a shady Windows program can.


## Flaws but not dealbreakers
Chrome OS will not work for everyone—especially those who need specific desktop apps that aren’t available for Chrome—but it does enough for most people. We recommend checking out Google’s “Get started with your new Chromebook” video to learn how Chromebooks work and what to expect.
Since Chromebooks need a constant Internet connection for many purposes, they’re not useful if you frequently work offline. While the offline modes offered by many services are fine for occasional use—during a flight, or in a coffee shop with poor Wi-Fi—you can’t even set up a Chromebook without an Internet connection, and you have to be online to set up offline modes.

The Chromebook Flip’s support for Android apps is useful, but it’s not enough to bridge the gap for anyone who needs full-fledged applications. Chrome OS has no great video, photo, or audio editors; Adobe Lightroom CC is available on the Flip as an Android app, but it’s not ideal for heavier editing. Even if apps were available, most Chromebooks lack the processing power for complex editing. If you rely on any desktop software, Chrome OS may not work for you—check out our Windows pick below.

The Chromebook Flip has two USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a microSD slot for expanded storage, and a headset jack, but no USB-A ports for existing accessories. We recommend grabbing a couple of USB-C–to–USB-A adapters or a hub if you need more ports.

After researching hundreds of laptops and testing six, we found that the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA is the best laptop that costs less than $500. It has a brighter screen, a more comfortable keyboard, and a more responsive trackpad than Windows laptops in this price range, and it’s powerful enough for most people’s needs. It’s faster at the tasks most people use laptops for: browsing the Web (even with a ton of tabs open), basic word processing, and watching movies.

If you need Windows apps or prefer to work offline, we recommend the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP401CA-DHMT4 because it’s the best Windows laptop under $500. Its Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of eMMC flash storage are enough to handle common tasks, though don’t expect to use Photoshop, Spotify, and have dozens of browser tabs open at the same time. The VivoBook Flip’s 14-inch, 1920×1080 IPS touchscreen is brighter and better to look at than other Windows laptops in this price range, and compared to those Windows computers, the VivoBook Flip has superior build quality and portability. But it can’t match the Chromebook Flip’s screen, build quality, and portability, and it lacks the Chromebook’s keyboard backlighting. Its battery also won’t last a full work or school day like the Chromebook’s, and, like all inexpensive Windows laptops, the VivoBook Flip 14 comes with a ton of bloatware. It also has only one USB-C port and a Micro-USB port: no USB-A ports.

The Spin 3 is gigantic and ugly, but it has the best performance and most storage for the price.

$500 from Acer
If the VivoBook Flip 14 isn’t available, or if you need a bigger screen, more ports, or a number pad on the keyboard, buy the Acer Spin 3 SP315-51-37UY. It has the best components of any laptop we tested for this review, including a 128 GB SSD, an Intel Core i3 processor, and 4 GB of memory. You can even add more memory later to run more apps and browser tabs simultaneously, which will also extend your laptop’s life for a couple years. But the Acer’s screen isn’t as bright and vibrant as our other picks’, the trackpad is rattly, and the gigantic plastic case feels cheap, scratches easily, and weighs nearly five pounds. And like the Flip 14, the Spin 3 comes with a ton of bloatware.

Why you should trust us
Wirecutter has been researching and testing laptops since 2013, and our PC team has more than 20 years of collective experience reviewing all kinds of laptops.

I’ve spent more than six years writing about technology and have spent a lifetime using, fixing, and toying with budget electronics. For this guide alone, I researched hundreds of laptops under $500, built spreadsheets to note every available configuration, and spent weeks working from a variety of budget laptops.

How we picked
Our three picks for laptop under $500

You’re not going to get a perfect laptop for less than $500—if it was perfect, it wouldn’t be cheap. The best configuration for a $500 Windows laptop is at least a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core i3 or Core m3 processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 64 GB or 128 GB solid-state or eMMC (flash) drive, and a 1080p screen. (Go higher than these specs if you can—8 GB of memory in particular makes a big difference—but never lower.) To learn what to look for in a Chromebook, head over to our Chromebook guide.

You can get laptops as cheap as $200, but you really shouldn’t—it’s more pleasant to browse the Web on your phone. You have to pay at least $450 for a usable Windows laptop. Cheaper laptops have slow hard drives or abysmal processors that can’t handle more than one or two applications at a time. They’re huge, creaky monstrosities with washed out screens and mediocre keyboards and trackpads that will likely fall apart within a year. If you can’t spend more than $450, you’ll have a better experience with a Chromebook or a tablet. Even at this price, you make serious trade-offs, so it’s worth knowing how components affect your experience:

Storage: Most Windows laptops at this price have spinning hard drives that feel unbearably slow—booting the laptop, launching apps, and browsing files take so long that you have time to take a sip of coffee and stretch before you can do anything. In our testing, we found that having flash storage (ideally an SSD, but an eMMC drive is also fast enough) instead of a traditional hard drive dramatically improved everyday performance, even more than a faster processor or more memory. But avoid Windows laptops with less than 64 GB of flash storage—you can’t run Windows updates on them without an external drive. You could buy a laptop with a hard drive and replace it with an SSD later to save some money, but that’s more than most people feel comfortable doing, so we concentrated on models that come with flash storage.
Processor: We recommend a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core m3, Core i3, or Core i5 processor. The Core i3 and m3 options will be fine for casual use and basic schoolwork but aren’t the best for multitasking; the Core i5 is faster and better at multitasking, but rare in this price range. Avoid AMD processors like the dual-core A9 and Intel Pentium and Celeron processors like the N4200 and N5000. We found these processors to be unusable for more than a single open app in our tests.
Memory: For less than $500, you rarely get more than 4 GB of memory without sacrificing flash storage or a decent processor. In our testing, we found that memory was the best spec to compromise on—a laptop with 4 GB of memory felt better to use than a laptop with more RAM but a hard drive or a slow processor. Laptop Mag found 4 GB of memory can run about 10 to 15 open browser tabs (assuming you don’t have any other apps open), and is good for basic document work with smaller files. Our tests found similar results, but once you open another app, the usable number of tabs plummets to five to 10 and decreases with each additional app. If you multitask in many apps at once, you’ll need more memory.
Screen: Cheap laptops tend to come with cheap 1366×768 screens. We preferred models with a resolution of 1920×1080, which offers a clear image and more screen real estate. We also recommend in-plane switching (IPS) screens because they’re more color accurate and have better viewing angles than TN (twisted nematic) panels. If you do a lot of media streaming, you’ll notice the difference.
Keyboard and trackpad: The keyboard and trackpad should be tolerable and responsive. Neither should annoy you so much that you seek out an external keyboard and mouse. Backlit keyboards are a bonus, but rare in this range.
Build quality: No budget laptop is a paragon of industrial design, but a computer shouldn’t feel like it’s going to break. Many laptops in this price range are massive 15-inch beasts with cheap plastic cases, loose keys, and rattly trackpads. A decent laptop should be sturdy, shouldn’t flex beneath your fingers when you type, and shouldn’t creak every time you click the trackpad or tap the spacebar.
Bloatware: Cheap Windows laptops come with a ton of bloatware, and it’s especially problematic on these laptops with slower processors, less memory, and limited storage. We recommend getting rid of useless applications with Should I Remove It? to speed up boot time, sew up potential security holes, and eliminate annoying notifications. In our tests, we experienced mild performance bumps after removing bloatware.
For $500, you don’t get much control over features we consider in more expensive laptops, like size, battery life, or ports, so while those details are nice to know, they didn’t make or break any of our picks. We just wanted to find usable laptops.

How we tested

To figure out which components have the greatest impact on general use, we first tested three Windows laptops:

One with an Intel Celeron processor, eMMC storage, and 4 GB of memory
One with a Core i3 processor, a hard drive, and 8 GB of memory
One with a Core i3 processor, SSD, and 4 GB of memory
We used each for a full day of work, which consisted of having a four to five applications open at once alongside a browser with 10 to 15 tabs. We also benchmarked each laptop with PC Mark 8’s Work and Home tests. Based on these tests, we found that flash storage is the most important component, followed by a decent processor, with 4 GB of memory being the best compromise to make.

Once we settled on our ideal configuration, we tested four Windows laptops and two Chromebooks by using each for at least a day of ordinary work to get a feel for their performance, screens, keyboards, and trackpads. For Chromebooks, we had at least 20 browser tabs open: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Spotify, Slack, and a variety of other sites. For Windows, we had five to 10 tabs open at a time, as well as the Spotify and Slack applications. We also tested opening large Excel spreadsheets, 100-page Word documents, and 200-page PDF files.

Our pick: Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA

Our pick
Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA
Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA
The best laptop under $500
Plenty of performance for everyday tasks, a comfortable backlit keyboard, and the build quality of laptops twice the price.

$475* from Amazon
$475 from Walmart
*At the time of publishing, the price was $470.

The Asus Chromebook Flip C302A is the best laptop under $500 for most people because it performs solidly and has a brighter screen, more responsive trackpad, and more comfortable backlit keyboard than its Windows competitors. It also features a sturdy, premium-feeling aluminum case. The Chromebook Flip costs about the same and has similar specs as the Windows laptop picks in this guide, but it feels much snappier for everyday work, plus it doesn’t come with bloatware and it’s more secure. But Chrome OS can’t run Windows apps, and because the Flip has only USB-C ports, you’ll need a dongle or adapter cable to connect your USB-A devices.

The Chromebook Flip has 64 GB of eMMC storage, which is fast enough that you won’t notice any slowdown in everyday use. It has plenty of room to store a few movies for a flight, and most of your data will live in the cloud anyway—Google provides 100 GB of Google Drive storage for two years. The Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor and 4 GB of RAM are also sufficient for Chrome OS, and the Chromebook Flip feels snappy to use, even if you’re used to high-end laptops. Even with 30 tabs open (with some playing media), the Chromebook Flip was quick and responsive. Because Chrome OS doesn’t need as much memory as Windows, Chromebooks didn’t suffer the same slowdowns we experienced under similar loads on similarly specced Windows laptops.

The Chromebook Flip’s IPS touchscreen is brighter and has better viewing angles than the one on the VivoBook Flip 14, our Windows pick; it’s great for media consumption and web browsing. At 12.5 inches, the 1920×1080-pixel screen is small—but not uncomfortably so for getting work done—especially compared to the VivoBook Flip 14’s 14-inch display or the Spin 3’s gargantuan 15-inch screen. Like our other picks, the Chromebook Flip has a 360-degree hinge so you can flip the screen around to use as a tablet, or in any intermediate position. This is more useful on the smaller Chromebook Flip than on the VivoBook Flip 14 or the massive 15-inch Spin 3.

The Chromebook Flip’s keyboard is comfortable and responsive, and the backlit keys are a rarity in laptops in this price range. The keys are nicely spaced and don’t feel cramped to type on, and the Chromebook Flip’s all-aluminum chassis makes for a sturdier typing experience than the VivoBook Flip 14’s plastic-bottom case. The trackpad feels smooth and accurate, especially when compared with the Spin 3’s rattly, loose trackpad.

The Chromebook Flip looks and feels like a higher-priced laptop—you could mistake it for a $1,000 ultrabook from across a coffee shop. After a year of regular use, the aluminum case and hinges on our test unit still look brand new aside from a couple scratches. The VivoBook Flip 14 has a similar case, but only the top is aluminum; the keyboard and trackpad are housed in plastic. The Chromebook consequently feels much more solid. Both Flips are higher quality than the Spin 3, a gigantic chunk of cheap plastic weighing in at 4.7 pounds. They’re lighter, too: The Chromebook Flip weighs just 2.65 pounds and the VivoBook Flip 14 comes in at 3.2 pounds. And unlike the behemoth Spin 3, the 12-by-8.3-by-0.6-inch Chromebook Flip and the 12.9-by-8.9-by-0.6-inch VivoBook Flip 14 are small enough to be easily portable.

In our battery-life test with the screen at 40 percent brightness and the keyboard backlight off, the Flip lasted 8 hours and 7 minutes. That means it’ll last about a full day at work or school, or the duration of a cross-country flight.

The three picks stacked on top of each other, showing the small aluminum Chromebook Flip, the slightly larger Vivobook, and the huge plastic Acer Spin 3.

Chromebooks are free from the worst part of cheap Windows laptops: bloatware. Every Chromebook comes with the operating system alone—no manufacturer-added software. You still have to update the operating system for new features and security enhancements, but these updates happen automatically and are much faster than Windows updates. Chromebooks are more secure than Windows laptops, too, because most malware (like ransomware, for example) isn’t made for Chromebooks. You’re limited to apps in the Chrome Web Store and Google Play; while those platforms aren’t completely free of malware, a bad extension or app can’t compromise your system in the same way as a shady Windows program can.

Flaws but not dealbreakers
Chrome OS will not work for everyone—especially those who need specific desktop apps that aren’t available for Chrome—but it does enough for most people. We recommend checking out Google’s “Get started with your new Chromebook” video to learn how Chromebooks work and what to expect.
Since Chromebooks need a constant Internet connection for many purposes, they’re not useful if you frequently work offline. While the offline modes offered by many services are fine for occasional use—during a flight, or in a coffee shop with poor Wi-Fi—you can’t even set up a Chromebook without an Internet connection, and you have to be online to set up offline modes.

The Chromebook Flip’s support for Android apps is useful, but it’s not enough to bridge the gap for anyone who needs full-fledged applications. Chrome OS has no great video, photo, or audio editors; Adobe Lightroom CC is available on the Flip as an Android app, but it’s not ideal for heavier editing. Even if apps were available, most Chromebooks lack the processing power for complex editing. If you rely on any desktop software, Chrome OS may not work for you—check out our Windows pick below.

Chrome OS will not work for everyone, but it does enough for most people.

The Chromebook Flip has two USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a microSD slot for expanded storage, and a headset jack, but no USB-A ports for existing accessories. We recommend grabbing a couple of USB-C–to–USB-A adapters or a hub if you need more ports.

## If you need Windows: Asus VivoBook Flip 14


After researching hundreds of laptops and testing six, we found that the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA is the best laptop that costs less than $500. It has a brighter screen, a more comfortable keyboard, and a more responsive trackpad than Windows laptops in this price range, and it’s powerful enough for most people’s needs. It’s faster at the tasks most people use laptops for: browsing the Web (even with a ton of tabs open), basic word processing, and watching movies. And since it’s a Chromebook, it’s free of the bloatware that slows down its Windows competitors.

Plenty of performance for everyday tasks, a comfortable backlit keyboard, and the build quality of laptops twice the price.

$475* from Amazon
$475 from Walmart
*At the time of publishing, the price was $470.

Chromebooks don’t run Windows, and most tasks require you to be online, but you can use Office apps in the browser (with a subscription) if you need to take occasional work home, and Chrome OS has viable replacements (including Android apps) for the software most people use. The Chromebook Flip’s 12.5-inch, 1920×1080 IPS touchscreen is crisp and vibrant, and its Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of flash storage are fast enough for most people. It’s small and lightweight, and its battery can last a full work day. The C302CA is also classier looking than its Windows counterparts in this price range—the aluminum case could be mistaken for that of a $1,000 ultrabook at a glance.

Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP401CA-DHMT4
Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP401CA-DHMT4
The best Windows laptop under $500
Sleek for a cheap Windows laptop, the VivoBook Flip 14 has a great screen, comfortable keyboard, and smooth trackpad, though it lacks a variety of ports.

$450 $400* from Amazon
You save $50 (11%)

$487 from Walmart
*At the time of publishing, the price was $450.

If you need Windows apps or prefer to work offline, we recommend the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP401CA-DHMT4 because it’s the best Windows laptop under $500. Its Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 64 GB of eMMC flash storage are enough to handle common tasks, though don’t expect to use Photoshop, Spotify, and have dozens of browser tabs open at the same time. The VivoBook Flip’s 14-inch, 1920×1080 IPS touchscreen is brighter and better to look at than other Windows laptops in this price range, and compared to those Windows computers, the VivoBook Flip has superior build quality and portability. But it can’t match the Chromebook Flip’s screen, build quality, and portability, and it lacks the Chromebook’s keyboard backlighting. Its battery also won’t last a full work or school day like the Chromebook’s, and, like all inexpensive Windows laptops, the VivoBook Flip 14 comes with a ton of bloatware. It also has only one USB-C port and a Micro-USB port: no USB-A ports.

Also great
Acer Spin 3 SP315-51-37UY
Acer Spin 3 SP315-51-37UY
A bulkier but more upgradeable Windows laptop
The Spin 3 is gigantic and ugly, but it has the best performance and most storage for the price.

$500 from Acer
If the VivoBook Flip 14 isn’t available, or if you need a bigger screen, more ports, or a number pad on the keyboard, buy the Acer Spin 3 SP315-51-37UY. It has the best components of any laptop we tested for this review, including a 128 GB SSD, an Intel Core i3 processor, and 4 GB of memory. You can even add more memory later to run more apps and browser tabs simultaneously, which will also extend your laptop’s life for a couple years. But the Acer’s screen isn’t as bright and vibrant as our other picks’, the trackpad is rattly, and the gigantic plastic case feels cheap, scratches easily, and weighs nearly five pounds. And like the Flip 14, the Spin 3 comes with a ton of bloatware.

Why you should trust us
Wirecutter has been researching and testing laptops since 2013, and our PC team has more than 20 years of collective experience reviewing all kinds of laptops.

I’ve spent more than six years writing about technology and have spent a lifetime using, fixing, and toying with budget electronics. For this guide alone, I researched hundreds of laptops under $500, built spreadsheets to note every available configuration, and spent weeks working from a variety of budget laptops.

Who this is for
Our picks are for anyone who doesn’t want to or cannot spend more than $500 on a laptop. These models are good for students who don’t need special software, anyone who just wants to browse the Web, and people who take work home only occasionally. If you can spend more or need a laptop capable of creative tasks, heavy multitasking, or gaming, take a look at our guide to the best laptops to find which suits your needs.

For less than $500, Chromebooks are better than Windows laptops because they’re faster at the things most people use a laptop for. In this price range, they also tend to have better build quality; superior screens, keyboards, and trackpads; and longer battery life than their Windows counterparts. Chromebooks don’t need antivirus software, don’t come with bloatware, and their system updates happen automatically.

Chromebooks run Chrome OS, an operating system that uses the Chrome Web browser as its primary interface. If you spend your computing time in a browser—checking email, using Google’s productivity suite, watching Netflix, or reading social media—then Chrome OS is all you need. But a Chromebook isn’t for everyone. For example, Chrome has limited options for photo, video, and audio editing software and programming text editors. Popular programs like Office 365 and Adobe Lightroom do have Web-based or Android versions, but if you need specialized software for work or school, you’re better off with Windows or macOS.

You should consider a $500 Windows laptop as a last resort if you have to buy a laptop right now.

Chromebooks also need an Internet connection for most tasks—you can’t even set one up without Internet access. Chromebooks do have offline options for Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, and Keep, as well as offline playback for movies, music, and some games. But the offline experience requires you to set it up while you have an Internet connection, and offline mode isn’t as cohesive as on Windows.

You should consider a $500 Windows laptop as a last resort if you have to buy a laptop right now. A $500 Windows laptop can handle basic web browsing, light app use, and media consumption, but not much more. It will buckle under the load of running four or five light apps at a time, so it isn’t great for heavy multitasking. Compared to a $700 laptop, it will feel worse in everyday use in two years and you’ll need to replace it sooner; a cheap laptop may cost you more in the long term. People who need a cheap Windows laptop are better off saving up for a $700 budget ultrabook or holding out for a sale—at the right time of year, even $600 can get you a more durable computer with better performance that will last longer than our picks.

If you don’t need Windows, you prefer Apple’s platforms, or you mostly watch videos and play games, an iPad with a keyboard case (or standalone keyboard) is snappier than a $400 Windows laptop for banging out a few emails, watching movies, or taking notes, and there are thousands of iPad-optimized apps and games. An iPad won’t run traditional desktop apps.

Our three picks for laptop under $500

You’re not going to get a perfect laptop for less than $500—if it was perfect, it wouldn’t be cheap. The best configuration for a $500 Windows laptop is at least a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core i3 or Core m3 processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 64 GB or 128 GB solid-state or eMMC (flash) drive, and a 1080p screen. (Go higher than these specs if you can—8 GB of memory in particular makes a big difference—but never lower.) To learn what to look for in a Chromebook, head over to our Chromebook guide.

You can get laptops as cheap as $200, but you really shouldn’t—it’s more pleasant to browse the Web on your phone. You have to pay at least $450 for a usable Windows laptop. Cheaper laptops have slow hard drives or abysmal processors that can’t handle more than one or two applications at a time. They’re huge, creaky monstrosities with washed out screens and mediocre keyboards and trackpads that will likely fall apart within a year. If you can’t spend more than $450, you’ll have a better experience with a Chromebook or a tablet. Even at this price, you make serious trade-offs, so it’s worth knowing how components affect your experience:

Storage: Most Windows laptops at this price have spinning hard drives that feel unbearably slow—booting the laptop, launching apps, and browsing files take so long that you have time to take a sip of coffee and stretch before you can do anything. In our testing, we found that having flash storage (ideally an SSD, but an eMMC drive is also fast enough) instead of a traditional hard drive dramatically improved everyday performance, even more than a faster processor or more memory. But avoid Windows laptops with less than 64 GB of flash storage—you can’t run Windows updates on them without an external drive. You could buy a laptop with a hard drive and replace it with an SSD later to save some money, but that’s more than most people feel comfortable doing, so we concentrated on models that come with flash storage.
Processor: We recommend a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core m3, Core i3, or Core i5 processor. The Core i3 and m3 options will be fine for casual use and basic schoolwork but aren’t the best for multitasking; the Core i5 is faster and better at multitasking, but rare in this price range. Avoid AMD processors like the dual-core A9 and Intel Pentium and Celeron processors like the N4200 and N5000. We found these processors to be unusable for more than a single open app in our tests.
Memory: For less than $500, you rarely get more than 4 GB of memory without sacrificing flash storage or a decent processor. In our testing, we found that memory was the best spec to compromise on—a laptop with 4 GB of memory felt better to use than a laptop with more RAM but a hard drive or a slow processor. Laptop Mag found 4 GB of memory can run about 10 to 15 open browser tabs (assuming you don’t have any other apps open), and is good for basic document work with smaller files. Our tests found similar results, but once you open another app, the usable number of tabs plummets to five to 10 and decreases with each additional app. If you multitask in many apps at once, you’ll need more memory.
Screen: Cheap laptops tend to come with cheap 1366×768 screens. We preferred models with a resolution of 1920×1080, which offers a clear image and more screen real estate. We also recommend in-plane switching (IPS) screens because they’re more color accurate and have better viewing angles than TN (twisted nematic) panels. If you do a lot of media streaming, you’ll notice the difference.
Keyboard and trackpad: The keyboard and trackpad should be tolerable and responsive. Neither should annoy you so much that you seek out an external keyboard and mouse. Backlit keyboards are a bonus, but rare in this range.
Build quality: No budget laptop is a paragon of industrial design, but a computer shouldn’t feel like it’s going to break. Many laptops in this price range are massive 15-inch beasts with cheap plastic cases, loose keys, and rattly trackpads. A decent laptop should be sturdy, shouldn’t flex beneath your fingers when you type, and shouldn’t creak every time you click the trackpad or tap the spacebar.
Bloatware: Cheap Windows laptops come with a ton of bloatware, and it’s especially problematic on these laptops with slower processors, less memory, and limited storage. We recommend getting rid of useless applications with Should I Remove It? to speed up boot time, sew up potential security holes, and eliminate annoying notifications. In our tests, we experienced mild performance bumps after removing bloatware.
For $500, you don’t get much control over features we consider in more expensive laptops, like size, battery life, or ports, so while those details are nice to know, they didn’t make or break any of our picks. We just wanted to find usable laptops.

Chrome OS has no great video, photo, or audio editors; Adobe Lightroom CC is available on the Flip as an Android app, but it’s not ideal for heavier editing. Even if apps were available, most Chromebooks lack the processing power for complex editing. If you rely on any desktop software, Chrome OS may not work for you—check out our Windows pick below.

Chrome OS will not work for everyone, but it does enough for most people.

The Chromebook Flip has two USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a microSD slot for expanded storage, and a headset jack, but no USB-A ports for existing accessories. We recommend grabbing a couple of USB-C–to–USB-A adapters or a hub if you need more ports.

## If you need Windows: Asus VivoBook Flip 14

If you need Windows on a budget, we recommend the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP401CA-DHM4T because it has 64 GB of speedy eMMC storage, a good-enough Intel Core m3 processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a bright, 14-inch screen. Its keyboard and trackpad are comfortable and responsive, and while the case isn’t as solid as the Chromebook Flip’s, it’s still of better quality than other laptops in this price range. The VivoBook Flip’s 4 GB of memory is a bigger limitation in Windows than on a Chromebook, and we couldn’t open as many tabs. Its battery also won’t last a full day like the Chromebook, and like all Windows laptops, it comes with a lot of bloatware.

The VivoBook Flip 14’s 64 GB of eMMC storage is a significant improvement over a spinning hard drive. It isn’t as speedy as a solid-state drive, but in our real-world tests, it felt just as responsive and snappy as the Acer Spin 3’s 128 GB SSD. (We don’t recommend the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 DH401CA-DHM6T; it has more storage but a lower-resolution, 1366×768 screen.) The VivoBook Flip 14’s Intel Core m3-7Y30 processor was less than two percent slower than the Acer Spin 3’s more powerful Core i3 processor in our tests; more importantly, both felt equally fast in real-world use.

Like our other picks, the VivoBook Flip 14 has 4 GB of RAM. Windows needs more RAM to run well than Chrome OS, and we could feel the difference in everyday use. That said, we were pleasantly surprised by how well the VivoBook Flip 14 handled a Web-centric workday—it can’t multitask as well as an ultrabook, but it’s effective for for casual browsing and single-application work. We even comfortably ran Microsoft Word, Spotify, and Chrome with five to 10 tabs open, so it should be capable enough for school work. When we tried to do more than that, we experienced input lag in the Word document and slow tab loading in Chrome. We pushed it even further, and mouse clicks stopped registering, audio playback stuttered, and, once, the screen gave up and turned all black.

The VivoBook Flip’s 14-inch, 1080p touchscreen can’t quite match the Chromebook Flip’s viewing angles or brightness, but it’s crisper and way better looking than every other $500 Windows laptop we considered. The Flip’s display washes out when viewed from more than about 45 degrees off center, and it’s not suitable for color-accurate work, but it’s fine for web browsing and movie watching. Asus includes a touchscreen pen with Windows Ink support if you want to write out notes. And like the Chromebook Flip, you can rotate the VivoBook Flip 14’s screen around to turn the laptop into a tablet, though the 14-inch laptop is uncomfortably large to hold in tablet mode.


The keyboard and trackpad on the VivoBook Flip 14 are similar to the Chromebook Flip’s—the keyboard is comfortable to type on for long durations, and the trackpad is responsive and smooth. But the VivoBook Flip 14 lacks the keyboard backlighting found in the Chromebook Flip and Spin 3. Unlike any other laptop we tested, the trackpad has a built-in fingerprint sensor, though it registered my fingerprint only about half the time.

The VivoBook Flip 14’s chassis is half great, half mediocre. The top portion that houses the display is aluminum, while the bottom half is aluminum-colored plastic. This is disappointing compared to the all-aluminum Chromebook Flip, and the bottom case flexes if you press down on it. But we didn’t notice any annoying creaking, and the people we showed it to were still impressed by the VivoBook Flip 14’s looks for its $450 price.

Unfortunately, Asus crams in a ton of bloatware. By our count, the VivoBook Flip 14 comes with 20 Asus-installed applications ranging from the bothersome McAfee LiveSafe to the unnecessary WPS Office. If you delete the 1 GB of bloatware, you’ll get a much more usable laptop that starts up faster, so we highly recommend doing so.

At 3.2 pounds, the VivoBook Flip 14 is portable enough, and its small bezels mean the VivoBook Flip 14 measures a reasonable 12.9 by 8.9 inches. (That’s less than an inch bigger than the Chromebook Flip, despite having a 1.5-inch larger screen.) The battery life won’t last you through a full workday, though—it lasted 5 hours and 2 minutes of in our simulated Web browsing battery test. Thankfully, the proprietary charger is small.



The VivoBook Flip 14 has an odd selection of ports: one Micro-HDMI, one SD card slot, a headphone jack, one USB-C, and one Micro-USB 2.0, but no USB-A ports. Like the Chromebook Flip, you’ll need a USB-C adapter to connect any legacy devices. If you need legacy ports, take a look at the Spin 3, which has three USB-A ports but lacks USB-C ports. The VivoBook Flip 14’s webcam is serviceable. In meetings using both the VivoBook Flip 14 and Chromebook Flip, co-workers told me I was blurry but the sound was surprisingly good. That’s better than the Spin 3’s tinny sound and blurry video.

The VivoBook Flip 14’s memory and storage are soldered on—and the case is super difficult to open—so you can’t upgrade this laptop. If you need an upgradable Windows laptop, check out the Acer Spin 3. But the VivoBook Flip 14 is a pretty decent Windows laptop today, which is the best you can ask for in this price range.



## An upgradable Windows laptop: Acer Spin 3

If the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 is exceptional, the Acer Spin 3 SP315-51-37UY is more in line with what we expect from a $500 laptop. It has the best components of any laptop we tested, including a speedy 128 GB SSD, an Intel Core i3 processor, and 4 GB of memory, plus you can upgrade it later when your budget allows. But you’ll make some important sacrifices: The screen is mediocre, the trackpad is rattly, and the gigantic plastic case feels cheap and weighs nearly five pounds. And like the VivoBook Flip 14, it comes with a ton of bloatware.

With a 128 GB solid-state drive, the Spin 3 has the fastest (and most) storage of any laptop we tested. The SSD provides speedy boot times and quick app launches, as well as plenty of room for most people’s data. The Intel Core i3-7100U processor is more than enough to handle basic Web browsing and lightweight app use. The processor is not noticeably better than the VivoBook Flip 14’s Core m3 processor, but it’s way better than the Celeron and Pentium processors common in this price range.

With the stock 4 GB of memory, the Spin 3 has the same constraints as the VivoBook Flip 14. We could comfortably run Spotify, Microsoft Word, and Chrome with five to 10 tabs open, but don’t expect more than 10 to 15 tabs (or three to four apps) at a time. However, unlike our other picks, the Spin 3 has an open slot to add more RAM. You have to remove 12 screws and the bottom panel to get to it, but you don’t need to move any components inside. Adding more memory will help with multitasking, like opening more programs at a time or having more tabs open in the browser.

The Spin 3’s biggest drawback is its mediocre 15-inch 1080p IPS screen. It’s not as bright and vibrant as the VivoBook Flip 14’s or Chromebook Flip’s and the dim display has washed out colors and abysmal viewing angles. If you plan on mostly watching Netflix, you’ll be better served by the Flip 14 or Chromebook Flip. But it’s not the worst we saw in this price range, and at least it’s clear and readable if you’re sitting in front of it. Like our other picks, the Spin 3 is a convertible with a touchscreen that can rotate all the way around—but at 15 inches, it’s absurd to use as a tablet unless you’re nine feet tall with Hulk-sized hands.

The Spin 3’s keyboard is large enough to include a number pad, but otherwise it’s merely serviceable, not exceptional: The shiny plastic keys have decent key travel and feel snappy to type on. The trackpad’s surface is smooth, but it produced a sad rattle when clicked. It’s not as bad as other trackpads we tested, which felt like clicking a hollow cardboard box, but both Flips’ trackpads are crisper feeling and more responsive than the Spin’s.

The Spin 3 is large and clunky, weighing 4.7 pounds and measuring 15 inches wide and nearly an inch thick. It’s not comfortably portable or particularly lappable. We scratched the top of the Spin 3’s cheap plastic case pretty badly taking it to and from the office a few times, so we recommend a sleeve (or covering the laptop in stickers) if you plan on taking it anywhere. Because its bulk makes it impractical to lug around—most people will use a laptop of this size at a desk or around the house for a few hours at a time—we didn’t run formal battery tests, but based on our informal use, we’d estimate around 6 hours of use per charge.


Of our picks, the Spin 3 has the most useful selection of ports, including HDMI, two USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0 port, an SD card slot, and a headphone jack. It lacks a more-versatile USB-C port, but at least you can plug your peripherals in without an adapter.

Like the Asus Windows pick, Acer loads up the Spin 3 with a ton of bloatware—it took us about 15 minutes to remove 22 Acer-installed applications. Doing so sped up the boot time by five seconds and even increased its performance benchmark scores by more than five percent.


## How to shop for a cheap laptop

For laptops under $500, we’ve found that inconsistent pricing, disappearing inventory, and retailer-exclusive deals make even educated shopping difficult. For example, at the time of this writing, Micro Center has a surprisingly good (and dirt cheap) Acer Aspire 3 configuration with an Intel Core i5 processor, 256 GB SSD, and 4 GB of RAM. But it’s available only in-store, and it will likely be more expensive or gone forever by the time you read this.

Because prices fluctuate, you never know when a $700 laptop will temporarily dive below $500. So if you don’t need a laptop right this second, you can get a great deal on a good laptop with a little patience. Here’s what you should look for: a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core i5 processor, a 128 GB or larger solid-state drive, 8 GB of memory, and a 1080p screen. This is the best configuration for most people who want a usable laptop for everyday use that’ll last four or five years. If you have to compromise, don’t go lower than a Core i3 or m3 processor and 4 GB of RAM.

Our Deals Editor Adam Burakowski told us that the best deals on laptops come around Christmas, but buying a refurbished model is an excellent way to save money year round. When shopping for a refurbished laptop, buy from the original manufacturer or an authorized dealer. Adam warned away from seller-refurbished models from places like Amazon, saying, “it’s questionable whether they’ll come through.”

When shopping for deals, stick to major websites with good return policies, like Amazon, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, or the manufacturer itself. Avoid sites with deals too good to be true like Buydig.

If possible, we recommend going to a physical store to touch the laptop you’re considering. Laptops in this price range tend to cheap out in unpredictable ways, whether it’s a clunky trackpad, mushy unresponsive keys, or a dim, washed-out screen, so getting hands-on time can save you the pain of returning something down the line.

If you can’t touch the computer before you buy it, a good return policy comes in handy. As soon as your laptop arrives, open the box carefully, keep all the parts and accessories, and give the computer a thorough test drive. If you spot anything you don’t like, return it to the manufacturer or store as soon as possible. Wait too long, and you’ll be stuck with it—some manufacturers give you only a two-week return window.

## he competition

Most Windows laptops under $500 are horrendous, and very few with our recommended specs even exist. Aside from the three Windows laptops we tested to find the best configuration for this price, we didn’t test anything that didn’t meet our minimum requirement of an Intel Core i3 or Core m3, 4 GB of RAM, and flash storage. If you’re curious about the Chromebook competition, head over to our Chromebook guide.

The Acer Aspire A515-51-3509 is a well-built (albeit large) laptop, but it’s hamstrung by a spinning hard drive. If you can find an Acer Aspire with our recommended specs for less than $500 we’ve found them to be solid laptops, but at the time of this writing there weren’t any available models with flash storage, a decent processor, and 4 GB of RAM.

The Acer Spin 1 SP111-32N-P0FA has an excellent screen and exceptional build quality for the price, but its Pentium N4200 processor is far too sluggish to get any real work done, and it can handle only four or five browser tabs and one app at a time. The Spin 1’s trackpad and keyboard are usable, and its compact size makes it portable, but the processor prevents it from being useful.

The Asus VivoBook F441BA-DS94 was the ugliest, heaviest, most awkward laptop we tested. The cheap plastic case feels like a Windows laptop from the ‘90s, and the screen’s colors invert at any angle other than straight on. And in our testing the AMD A9-9420 processor was too slow, which caused long boot times, slow application launches, and a huge slowdown with just four to five browser tabs.
